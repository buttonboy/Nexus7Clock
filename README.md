A simple website displaying time and weather.

Tapping the time will make the site go into full screen mode.

Tapping the weather will toggle between displaying a forcast with current temp or just displaying current temp.

Make sure to edit <b>js/weather.js</b> and add your darksky api key and the lat and long for where you would like to get weather.

To get your API Key go to https://darksky.net/dev and create an account.
